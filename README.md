#Sentence auto complete
### The project returns the best completion options for a given prefix of sentence:
The user starts typing the sentence he's in search for, the program recievs the partial sentence that was typed and returns 5 of the best options for completion.
In order for the completion options to apear quickly we work in two phases: offline and online.

### Offline
We run offline a program that will parse all the possible sentences into a map with keys representing the prefix. 
After parsing to a map it will only take the program when its online O(1).

### Online
We recieve the prefix and access the map we have from the Offline phase with prefix being the key. As we said the time complexity is O(1).
If there's a hit: The values returned from the map are the completion options for the prefix. If there's a miss: We calculate the best completion by assuming he was one charater wrong.

### Implementation:
The project was implement with C++17 in Linux. The design is based on MVC architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
